- El estandard necesitara desarrollo formal.


What method will build trust and encourage engagement with your audience?
- foro publico de discusion
- reunión presencial para discutirlo

## Outcomes

- El standard se convierte en la forma por defecto en publicar datos de feminicidios.

## Objetivos

* Provee una guia: Ayuda a gente y organizaciones a ponerse de acuerdo en conceptos.
* Compartir vocabulario: A través categorización de nombres, códigos y definiciones de conceptos comunes.
* Provee formatos: Que apoyen la pubilcación consistente de datos.

## Acuerdo tecnico

The reusable agreement is a technical document that lays out what data is published and how. The agreement makes it clear 
- what’s in scope, 
- what’s required (or not), 
- how data is collected, put together and published. 

It can also include how data is arranged for sharing including the types of files that are acceptable.

## Apoyo a Organizaciones

To support people and organisations using the open standard, it’s important to provide clear guidance tuned to their language. 
- Guidance can be how-to guides, 
- visual aids, 
- videos, 
- workshops and more.

# Proceso

## Research

### Identify stakeholders 

who should be involved in developing or using the standard - for example, who are the producers of the data and who are the consumers?

## Gather requirements 
by exploring the user needs of those stakeholders, their existing approaches to guidance, publishing or using data, the existing tools that support them and any regulations that apply.

## Understand the existing standards landscape 
to determine the appropriate scope for any new work, for example is your standard completely new or an extension of an existing standard?

## Find and analyse existing resources to identify use case, including case studies, data, guides and vocabularies that fall into the scope of the standard

## Decide on appropriate process for further development, 

* For example, will the work be carried out within a formal development process? 
* Are there regulations or legislation to take into account?

### Outcomes

#### Stakeholder mapping

Including the people and organisations who will adopt the standard first, stakeholders who will use the standard itself and those who will use or be affected by the outputs.

#### Scope, requirement and use cases

Including the vision for the standard, a strong rationale, and compelling use cases that outline why the standard is being developed, the problem it solves, who will use it and how.


## Start Development

* Create an open call for participation and collaboration to engage with the stakeholder community. Proactively target known stakeholders to encourage their participation.
* Communicate the expected roadmap for the development activities, including a timescale and modes of engagement over time.
* Document and share the scope, requirements and use cases that will guide the development of the standard. Where these will be refined during the standards process, then this should be clear on the roadmap.
* Ensuring that there is a clear governance structure for the project, for example who is coordinating or leading the standards group, how will issues be raised and reported, and how disputes will be resolved.
* Clarify the intellectual property framework within which work will be carried out, e.g. that all contributions and output will be openly published and that any IP or patent rights are addressed. 
* Consider the funding model to cover the costs of development, engagement, support and advocacy during the development of the standard.

### Outcomes

#### Governance and intellectual property guidelines

Outlining the initial decisions about how the standard will be governed and who owns intellectual property on documents and data.

#### Funding model

Outlining how development, advocacy and engagement will be funded and who is providing the funding.
