    We put people first in our projects
    We have an internal data sharing policy that makes it clear when, how, and with what consent we can share data with others
    We use and support open source technology
    We incorporate responsible data support when working with partners to design and implement projects
    We make our sources of revenue transparent so that others can determine if there are any conflicts they may have in working with us
    When we collect data about people or organisations we communicate clearly about that collection to allow for informed consent and an opt-in process
    We do not collect data about people, organizations, or activities that we do not have clear intent to use productively
    We invest core resources to actively participate in and facilitate the responsible data community of practice
    We set high operational security standards for our team, and provide them with the support they need to meet them
